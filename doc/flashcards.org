* Scheme basics

1) Explain the difference between '+, +, and (+).

2) What's the value of
   #+begin_src scheme
     (define (sum x y)
       (+ x y))
     (sum 2 3)
   #+end_src

3) Using the substitution rule, what steps does scheme take to arrive
   at the answer to #2?

4) What does scheme do when I call =(do 4 4)=?
   #+begin_src scheme
     (define (do x y)
       (if (= x y)
          (square x)
          (square y)))
   #+end_src
