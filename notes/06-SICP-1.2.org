* Chapter 1.2
** Section 1.2.3
*** Do Exercise 1.14
    We haven't practiced drawing trees of function calls much, just
    draw the answer on a piece of paper.

*** Skip Exercise 1.15

** Section 1.2.4
   Remember exponation is just squared, cubed, etc. This section is
   interesting because we solve the problem two different ways, and
   the second way takes fewer steps.

*** Skip Exercise 1.16
    This exercise and 1.18 are just an iterative version of the
    recursive procedure. It's good practice, so do it if you feel like
    it.

*** Do Exercise 1.17

*** Skip Exercise 1.18
    Do this if you did 1.16.

*** Skip Exercise 1.19
** Section 1.2.5
   This is just another discussion of a recursive process. The
   interesting part is the discussion of Euclid's Algorithm, so it
   shouldn't be important to have a clear sense of what a GCD is
   before you start.

*** Discuss Exercise 1.2.5
    An interesting test of how much you understand the steps scheme
    uses. We can do more interpreter tracing together to talk about
    this one.

** Section 1.2.6
   A bunch more math, but important concepts.

*** Do Exercise 1.21

*** Skip Exercise 1.22
    We're going to skip the next four exercises just so we don't have
    to deal with the profiler yet.

*** Skip Exercise 1.23
*** Skip Exercise 1.23
*** Skip Exercise 1.24
*** Do Exercise 1.25
*** Do Exercise 1.26
*** Skip Exercise 1.27
*** Skip Exercise 1.28
