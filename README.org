Woooo, chapter two! I think we should try for the first three
sections, this material is a little easier than the last couple of
sections have been. Section 2.1.3 is a little trickier, and also is
very cool.

** Exercise 2.1
** Exercise 2.2
** Exercise 2.3
** Exercise 2.4
** Exercise 2.5
** Exercise 2.6
