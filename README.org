This repository contains a library defining setences as used by the
Berkely CS61A Lecture series and the working file for each hackrec
class.

** 1.3.2
*** Exercise 1.34

Step through the substitution as though =g= were any regular
parameter. It might be helpful to say "apply procedure" to yourself
when you see an open paren.

** 1.3.3

This section is real math heavy even by the fairly generous standards
that we've been using, so read through it but don't get too bogged
down in the math.

*** Exercise 1.36

This refers to using display and newline to see what's going on from
back in Exercise 1.22, which we skipped. Sorry about that. We've
talked about it in class, though.
