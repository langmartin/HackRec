The Newton's method example uses some light calculus, but they define
all the bits that you need for you right in the chapter. The
definition for deriv is pretty cool if you recall what a derivative
is.

** Exercise 1.40
** Exercise 1.41
** Exercise 1.42
** Exercise 1.43
** Exercise 1.44
** Optional 1.45
This looks like it will take a lot of time, so don't worry about it if
you don't get to it.

** Optional 1.46
Also lots of time.
